# TerraItemsAdderAddon
ItemsAdder block addon for Terra (adds a terrascript function)

## Credit
This is just a modified version of dfsek's MythicMobs addon for terra, so full credit goes to dfsek for basically all the code, I just modified it to work with Itemsadder blocks instead

## How to use
1. Download or build this addon and place it in the addons folder of your Terra folder.
2. Add "ItemsAdder" to the "addons" key of the pack.yml of any packs you'd like to apply it to.
3. now you can use the itemsAdderBlock() function in any terrascript file.
   The format is itemsAdderBlock(x,y,z,"itemsadder_block_id")
   
> This addon is only for itemsadder blocks, it will not work for spawning entities.
